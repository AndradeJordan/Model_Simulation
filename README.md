# Model_Simulation

The Black Scholes and Heston stock prices are being examined in this project. The Black Scholes model is based on the assumption that volatility is constant, but the Heston model allows stochastic volatility, which is more customizable and has better performance with empirical data. Analyzing and simulating both models is done.
